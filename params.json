If you like them, feel free to use or modify the contents. Feedbacks are welcomed :)\r\n\r\nYou can clone this repository to download the notebooks, or browse the NBViewer generated static links below:\r\n\r\n1. [Monte Carlo Simulation of the Ising Model (Python)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MSeeker/Notebook-Collections/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation%20of%20the%20Ising%20Model.ipynb)\r\n\r\n2. [Numerical Solution to the 1D Steady State Schrödinger Equation (Python)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MSeeker/Notebook-Collections/blob/master/Numerical%20Solution%20to%20the%201D%20Steady%20State%20Schrödinger%20Equation.ipynb)\r\n\r\n3. (WIP) Generating Bifurcation Diagrams using Continuation Methods (Julia)\r\n\r\n# About Me\r\n\r\nI'm a junior physics major at Peking University. Like many of you I'm a keen supporter of open-source scientific libraries, and I'm eager to contribute to the community. Currently my research interest lies in the *ab-initio* simulation of closed quantum systems, which I plan to do my B.S. thesis in. I plan to begin contributing to the Julia Quantum project and/or the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) project in the near future.\r\n\r\n[Email](mailto:guoxj1995@pku.edu.cn)\r\n",
