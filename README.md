# MSeeker's Notebook Collections

This is a collection of Python & Julia notebooks that I have created in class projects, seminars and side projects. If you like them, feel free to use or modify the contents. Feedbacks are welcomed :)

You can clone this repository to download the notebooks, or browse the NBViewer generated static links below:
1. Monte Carlo Simulation of the Ising Model (Python)[TODO]

2. Numerical Solution to the 1D Steady State Schr√∂dinger Equation (Python)[TODO]

3. Generating Bifurcation Diagrams using Continuation Methods (Julia)[TODO]

# About Me

I'm a junior physics major at Peking University. Like many of you I'm a keen supporter of open-source scientific libraries, and I'm eager to contribute to the community. Currently my research interest lies in the *ab-initio* simulation of closed quantum systems, which I plan to do my B.S. thesis in. I plan to begin contributing to the Julia Quantum project and/or the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) project in the near future.
